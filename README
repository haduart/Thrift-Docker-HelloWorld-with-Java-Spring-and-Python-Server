Working on localhost

Starting the Python Thrift Server

cd python-server-thrift/
source bin/activate
python PythonServer.py


Starting the Java Thrift Client, that is at the same time a REST Server.
cd java-client-thrift/
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run


Testing it.

curl http://localhost:8080/hello

Java REST server is listening on port 8080, starts a thrift client and connects to the thirft server at port 9090.


Working with Docker-Compose

First Compiling the Java Client

cd java-client-thrift/
mvn clean install

Then using the docker-compose commands.

cd ../

docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs -f

If you want to stop them
docker-compose down
And if you want to delete them completely
docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes
